# Promotion Checklist (Daily -> Long-term)

Promote a note from `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` to `MEMORY.md` if any are true:

- Repeated in multiple conversations
- Strong preference affecting response style
- Important personal/workflow boundary
- Ongoing project context likely needed later
- Recurring blocker likely to reappear

Do not promote if:

- One-off detail with no future value
- Sensitive secret not required for assistance
- Unverified assumption

# Forgetting & Demotion Checklist

Demote or delete when any are true:

- Preference contradicted explicitly by user
- Hypothesis still unvalidated after 5 sessions
- Project abandoned/replaced
- User requests forgetting

Actions:

- Long-term fact -> move to daily note with `stale` annotation
- Hypothesis -> mark `discarded` with one-line reason
- Explicit forget request -> remove immediately from long-term memory

# Confidence Decay Rules (Hypotheses)

- High -> Medium after 14 days without reinforcement
- Medium -> Low after 30 days without reinforcement
- Low -> Discard after 60 days without reinforcement

Reinforcement:

- repeated behavior alignment
- explicit user confirmation
